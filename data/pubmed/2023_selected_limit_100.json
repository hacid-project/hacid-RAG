        "abstract_text": "Hazard assessments of skin sensitizers are increasingly performed using new approach methodologies (NAMs), with several in chemico, in vitro, and most recently, also defined approaches accepted for regulatory use. However, keeping track of potential limitations of each method to define applicability domains remains a crucial component to ensure adequate predictivity and to facilitate the appropriate selection of method(s) for each hazard assessment task. The objective of this report is to share test results generated with the GARD\u2122skin assay on chemicals that have traditionally been considered difficult to test in some of the conventional in vitro and in chemico OECD Test Guidelines for skin sensitization. Such compounds may include, for example, indirectly acting haptens, hydrophobic substances, and substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products or biological substances (UVCBs). Based on the results of this study, the sensitivity for prediction of skin sensitizing hazard of indirectly acting haptens was 92.4% and 87.5% when compared with local lymph node assay (LLNA) (n = 25) and human data (n = 8), respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity for prediction of skin sensitizing hazard of hydrophobic substances was 85.1% and 100% when compared with LLNA (n = 24) and human data (n = 9), respectively. Lastly, a case study involving assessment of a set of hydrophobic UVCBs (n = 7) resulted in a sensitivity of 100% compared to available reference data. These data provide support for the inclusion of such chemistries in the GARD\u2122skin applicability domain without an increased risk of false negative classifications.",

In mental health services, particular attention is paid to harm arising from the actions of patients against themselves or others. The primary intention of examining these adverse events is to inform changes to care provision so as to reduce the likelihood of the recurrence of such events. The predominant approach to investigating adverse incidents has relied on the cause-and-effect conceptualisation of past events. Whilst the merits of approaches which are reliant on cause-and-effect narratives have been questioned, alternatives models to explain adverse incidents in health settings have not been theoretically or empirically tested. This novel article (i) examines the notion of causation (and the related notion of omission) in the context of explaining adverse events in mental health settings, and (ii) draws on a long-established discipline devoted to the study of how the past is interpreted (namely historiography) to theoretically investigate the innovative application of two historiographical approaches (i.e. counterfactual analysis and historical materialism) to understanding adverse events in mental health settings.",

Several factors contribute to the uncontrolled expression of certain genes in cancer thus making them act as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. In this study, we have examined four microarray datasets of high-grade ovarian cancer cells to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). 362 and 94 common DEGs were identified as up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively from 119 disease and 31 control samples. The DEGs were further analysed for their gene ontologies (GO), pathway, protein-protein interactions and co-expression. Most of the biological processes were associated with cellular processes, biological regulation, metabolic processes, and developmental processes. Further, regulatory networks were constructed by the DEGs which are also co-expressed and the hub genes were identified. The hub genes targeted by a large number of microRNAs (miRNAs) were further analyzed to reveal their role in the overall survival of cancer patients. Finally, GBP5 and ACSS3 were highlighted as potential biomarkers for ovarian cancer research.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

Estrogen and progesterone receptors have been detected on lacrimal glands and ACCs of salivary glands. Thus, hormonal changes during pregnancy might contribute to the recurrence of ACC.

We conducted participant observation and semi-structured interviews with patients to investigate their experience of the NSSC-CPP with a specific focus on their perception of symptoms and their thoughts on worrying about cancer. We found that the phrase 'worried about cancer' was not recognised by the participants, but worry was visible in their increased healthcare use and their interpretation of bodily sensations.

To determine the incidence and risk factors of developing ACS, State Inpatient Databases, State Emergency Department Databases, and State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, were used to retrospectively identify patients 1-18 years of age with tibia fractures from 2006 to 2015 (quarter 3). The HCUP Nationwide Emergency Department Sample for nationwide data was also queried. Multivariable generalized estimating equations models were used to determine risk factors associated with development of ACS. A total of 50 640 patients with tibia fractures were studied, and 309 cases of ACS were identified. The incidence of ACS was 0.6 and 5.5% in the all tibia and open tibia fracture groups, respectively. Twenty-three cases of ACS (7.4% of all ACS) were diagnosed after discharge from the index admission, which was more common in teens treated nonoperatively. Predictors of increased ACS risk in the all tibia fracture group included age 13-18 [relative risk (RR): 4.04)], open fractures (RR: 3.83), and motor vehicle crash (MVC) mechanism (RR: 5.69). Nationwide, open and operatively treated fractures had an increased ACS rate (3.98 and 5.51%, respectively). Teenagers, open fractures, and MVC mechanisms were most strongly associated with ACS.

The purpose of this study is the analysis of indications, complications, and duration of treatment using intramedullary flexible nails in children who are still growing but especially weighing 50 kg or more. Hospital records from 2017 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed to identify the children from 4 to 17 years of age with displaced tibial shaft fractures admitted to the hospital. Only children with open growth cartilage, with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up and complete clinical data, were included. Studies of 91 children xwere analyzed. The average patient age at the time of the injury was 10.88 \u00b1 2.82 years. In the entire group, 31.9% children weighed 50 kg or more, and 68.1% of the children were below this weight. All children were treated using ESIN. The mean time to nail removal was 8.4 \u00b1 4.09 months in the whole group of children stabilized with ESIN. There were no differences in the two groups depending on the weight ( P = 0.637). Only two adverse events were observed. This study demonstrates that the use of ESIN in displaced tibial shaft fractures in growing children weighing 50 kg or more is acceptable and safe. The discussion to be made is whether it is still an acceptable method of treatment for this type of fracture due to the progressive obesity epidemic in children and adolescents.",

To address this gap of knowledge, we obtained fibulae from 30 skeletally intact donors at autopsy (each 15 male and female), which were analyzed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography\u00a0including micro-finite element analysis. Scans were performed in a 7-cm volume of interest\u00a0and evaluated in three subregions according to the Danis-Weber fracture classification. Group comparisons and linear regression analyses were applied to evaluate the effects of age, sex, and subregion. From distal to proximal, we observed an increase of cortical parameters and a decrease of trabecular parameters. Age was primarily associated with a cortical decrease in all subregions (Danis-Weber type A, B, and C) in women. While women showed a greater magnitude of decline, men also exhibited an age-associated decrease for some parameters, including cortical area and cortical thickness in the type C subregion. Stiffness and failure load were highest in the type C subregion in both women and men. A critical age-related decline in bone strength parameters in the type B subregion was observed in women, providing an explanation for the increased incidence of low-traumatic type B fractures in the elderly. Together, these findings extend the current understanding of distal fibular microarchitecture, likely explaining the epidemiologic features of distal fibula fractures and emphasizing the need for age-adapted treatment algorithms.",

However, estimates for irreproducibility of preclinical science range from 75% to 90%. The importance of reproducible science has not been assessed in the context of mechanics-based modeling of human joints such as the knee, despite this being an area that has seen dramatic growth. Framed in the context of five experienced teams currently documenting knee modeling procedures, the aim of this study was to evaluate reporting and the perceived potential for reproducibility across studies the teams viewed as important contributions to the literature. A cohort of studies was selected by polling, which resulted in an assessment of nine studies as opposed to a broader analysis across the literature. Using a published checklist for reporting of modeling features, the cohort was evaluated for both \"reporting\" and their potential to be \"reproduced,\" which was delineated into six major modeling categories and three subcategories. Logistic regression analysis revealed that for individual modeling categories, the proportion of \"reported\" occurrences ranged from 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.23, 0.41] to 0.77, 95% CI: [0.68, 0.86]. The proportion of whether a category was perceived as \"reproducible\" ranged from 0.22, 95% CI: [0.15, 0.31] to 0.44, 95% CI: [0.35, 0.55].

First, do IRB members think the potential medical benefits of average phase 1 pediatric oncology trials justify the risks? Second, do they think these trials are ethically appropriate? Third, do they think these trials are approvable? Fourth, how do the views of IRB members on the first two questions compare to the views of the US public? Of the 80 respondents who answered the test questions correctly, 18.8% stated that the potential medical benefits of average phase 1 pediatric oncology trials outweigh the risks, 32.5% stated that the potential medical benefits and risks are about equal, and 48.8% stated that the risks outweigh the potential medical benefits. Compared to the general public, IRB members were significantly more likely to think the risks outweigh the potential medical benefits (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Finally, 68.8% of IRB members indicated that average phase 1 pediatric oncology trials are approvable, and 56.3% indicated that these trials are appropriate in children. These findings suggest two-thirds of IRB members believe average phase 1 pediatric oncology trials are approvable. Yet, almost half regard the risks as outweighing the potential medical benefits and almost half think these trials are inappropriate. These findings raise important questions regarding why IRB members and the general public evaluate the same risk/benefit profile differently, and whether it is possible to reconcile the two perspectives.",

Individual fixed-effects models are estimated from Norwegian register data containing information about consultations with a general practitioner because of mental health conditions in 2006-19. Mental health, as indicated by annual number of consultations, improves over several years before cohabitation. For those marrying their cohabiting partner, there is a weak further reduction in consultations until the wedding, but no decline afterwards. In other words, formalization of the union does not seem to confer additional mental health benefits. However, marriage may be considered a marker of favourable earlier development in mental health. In contrast, there is further improvement after direct marriage, as well as stronger improvement over the years just preceding direct marriage. Patterns are quite similar for women and men. Overall, the results suggest that the mental health benefits of cohabitation and marriage are similar.<i>Supplementary material for this article is available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2022.2063933. <i>Note:</i> numbers in brackets refer to supplementary notes that can be found at the end of the supplementary material.</i>",

Then, compounds (5a-c) were reacted with 1-bromo-3-chloropropane under nano-CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst in water solvent to give S-alkylated quinazolinone core intermediate (6a-c), which was subsequently reacted with 1-substituted-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol (2a-g) by employing the similar reaction conditions to afford the final target compounds. The regioselective formation of C-S bond was unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The anti-cancer activity of the derivatives on various cancer cell lines such as SIHA, MD-AMB-231 and HepG2 was evaluated.

We developed retrospective cohorts of patients with hypertension or diabetes receiving primary care from this UIHO, measuring differences between AI/AN, Spanish-preferring Latinx, English-preferring Latinx, Black, and White patients in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean hemoglobin A1c (A1c) as primary outcomes. To assess processes of care, we also compared visit intensity, missed visits, and medication treatment intensity in regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. For hypertension (n\u2009=\u20092148), adjusted mean SBP ranged from 135.8\u00a0mm Hg among Whites to 141.3\u00a0mm Hg among Blacks (p\u2009=\u20090.06). For diabetes (n\u2009=\u20091211), adjusted A1c ranged from 7.7% among English-preferring Latinx to 8.7% among Blacks (p\u2009=\u20090.38). Care processes for both hypertension and diabetes varied across groups. No group consistently received lower-quality care. This UIHO provided care of comparable quality for hypertension and diabetes among urban-dwelling AI/ANs and members of other racial, ethnic, and language preference groups. Systematic assessments of care quality in UIHOs may help demonstrate the importance of their role in providing care and improve the quality of care.",

        "abstract_text": "One of the recent major advances in cognitive psychology research has been the option of web-based in addition to lab-based experimental research. This option fosters experimental research by increasing the pace and size of collecting data sets. Importantly, web-based research profits heavily from integrating tasks that are frequently applied in cognitive psychology into open access software. For instance, an open access random-dot kinematogram (RDK) plugin has recently been integrated into the jsPsych software for web-based research. This plugin allows researchers to implement experimental tasks with varying coherence levels (with that varying task difficulty) of moving dots or varying signal to noise ratios of colored dots. Here, we introduce the random-object kinematogram (ROK) plugin for the jsPsych software which, among other new features, enables researchers to include oriented objects (e.g., triangles or arrows) instead of dots as stimuli. This permits experiments with feature congruency (e.g., upwards-moving triangles pointing upwards) or incongruency (e.g., upwards-moving triangles pointing downwards), allowing to induce gradual degrees of stimulus interference, in addition to gradual degrees of task difficulty. We elaborate on possible set-ups with this plugin in two experiments examining participants' RTs and error rates on different combinations of coherence and congruency levels. Results showed increased RTs and error rates on trials with lower coherence percentages, and on trials with lower congruency levels. We discuss other new features of the ROK plugin and conclude that the possibility of gradually varying the coherence level and congruency level independently from each other offers novel possibilities when conducting web-based experiments.",

We performed a scoping review to collect, summarise, and discuss the existing scientific research about the relationships between noise exposure during pregnancy and congenital anomalies and/or perinatal mortality. We searched electronic databases for papers published between 1970 and March 2021. We included 16 studies (seven on congenital anomalies, three on perinatal mortality, and two on both congenital anomalies and perinatal mortality). We assessed four studies on congenital hearing dysfunction as the definition of congenital anomalies includes functional anomalies. We found few studies on this topic and no studies on the combined effects of occupational and environmental noise exposures. Evidence suggests a small increase in the risk of congenital anomalies in relation to occupational and to a lesser extent environmental noise exposure. In addition, few studies investigated perinatal mortality and the ones that did, used different outcome definitions, so no conclusions could be\u00a0made. However, a recent big cross-sectional study demonstrated an association between road traffic noise and stillbirth.

Computational approaches have proven useful in understanding the structural properties of molecules and the key binding with other constituents. In this review, comprehensive information on the structure and function of lactoferrin and the binding with various molecules for food purposes are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the use of molecular dynamics simulations. The results demonstrate the application of modeling and simulations to determine key residues of lactoferrin responsible for its stability and interactions with other biomolecular components under various conditions, which are also associated with its functional benefits.

Antimicrobials are empirically used in COVID-19 patients. During the initial phase of this pandemic, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin and doxycycline were widely suggested for possible prophylaxis or treatment for COVID-19 in outpatient as well as hospitalized settings.

Methane gas has a global warming potential that is estimated to be 25-36 over 100&#160;years. Interestingly, methane generated from landfills is a renewable source of energy that has been used over the years as a source of electricity generation especially in developed and in some developing countries. However, methane from landfills has been underutilized in South Africa. Due to the recent unreliable electricity disruptions (load shedding) in South Africa, which is caused by a variety of factors. Prioritizing methane produced from landfills for use as a fuel for electricity generation is critical. This will assist to minimize the over-reliance on coal and, reduce the ongoing landfill gas generation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to estimate the amount of methane emitted from Weltervenden landfill site using the LandGEM version 3.02 and Afvalzorg models and to evaluate the potential utilization of the gases emitted. The study was also aimed at determining the cost and benefits related to the implementation of a landfill gas utilization technology. The findings of this study show that methane emissions from the landfill will peak in the year 2023 with values of 4613&#160;Mg/year and 3128&#160;Mg/year for LandGem and Afvalzorg models, respectively. Also, the total methane emissions from the year 1999 to 2050, are 111,799.25&#160;Mg/year and 27,898.93&#160;Mg/year for both LandGEM and Afvalzorg models, respectively. The LFGcost web model simulations showed that the implementation of a LFG utilization project using Microturbine and CHP microturbine engines are economically feasible.

This study intends to validate whether cold plasma contributes to improving callogenesis performance and eliciting the production of cannabinoids in cannabis. The cannabis-derived calli were treated with plasma at different exposure times, including 0, 60, 120, and 180\u00a0s. The plasma priming improved the callogenesis performance and callus biomass by an average of 46.6%. The molecular assessment (MSAP method) validated how the plasma priming is epigenetically associated with variation in DNA methylome in the cannabis calli. The cold plasma treatments transcriptionally upregulated the expression of WRKY1 and ERF1B transcription factors by averages of 3.5- and 3.8-fold. The plasma treatment also stimulated the transcription of OLS, OAC, CBGAS, CBDAS, and THCAS genes involved in the biosynthesis of cannabinoids. The HPLC assessment proved the high potency of cold plasma to enhance the synthesis of cannabinoids, including Cannabigerol (CBG), Cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabinol (CBN). The plasma-primed calli contained higher concentrations of proteins (56%), proline (38%), and soluble phenols (40%). The activities of peroxidase and catalase enzymes showed a similar upward trend in response to the plasma. The profound increase in the concentrations of soluble sugars resulted from the plasma treatments. The plasma priming of calli contributed to the significant upregulation in the activity of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzyme.

In the present study, we analyzed Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) CPK genes and their closely related five gene families (Brachypodium distachyon, Hordeum vulgare L., Oryza sativa, Setaria italica, and Zea mays) comprehensively, including phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, and synteny analysis. Thirty Moso bamboo CPKs were divided into four subgroups; in each subgroup, the constituent parts of gene structure were relatively conserved. Furthermore, analysis of expression profiles showed that most PheCPK genes are significantly upregulated under drought and cold stress, especially PheCPK1. Overexpression of PheCPK1 in Arabidopsis reduced plant tolerance to drought stress, as determined through physiological analyses of the relative water content, relative electrical leakage, and malondialdehyde content. It also activated the expressions of stress-related genes. In addition, overexpression of PheCPK1 in Arabidopsis exhibited significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability. Taken together, these results suggest that PheCPK1 may act as a negative regulator involved in the drought stress responses.",

SET And MYND Domain Containing 2 (SMYD2) serves as an oncogene in various cancers. However, whether SMYD2 is involved in tumor angiogenesis remains unclear. Here, we report that SMYD2 expression is associated with microvessel density in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. SMYD2 promotes CRC angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SMYD2 physically interacts with HNRNPK and mediates lysine monomethylation at K422 of HNRNPK, which substantially increases RNA binding activity. HNRNPK acts by binding and stabilizing EGFL7 mRNA. As an angiogenic stimulant, EGFL7 enhances CRC angiogenesis. H3K4me3 maintained by PHF8 mediates the abnormal overexpression of SMYD2 in CRC. Moreover, targeting SMYD2 blocks CRC angiogenesis in tumor xenografts. Treatment with BAY-598, a functional inhibitor of SMYD2, can also synergize with apatinib in patient-derived xenografts. Overall, our findings reveal a new regulatory axis of CRC angiogenesis and provide a potential strategy for antiangiogenic therapy.",

Increasing evidence has revealed their potential protective effects against CLGI in chronic conditions. However, this property has not been systematically discussed and summarized. In the present work, numerous published reports were reviewed to systematically analyze and summarize the protective effects of coarse cereals and their main active ingredients against CLGI. Their current utilization state was investigated. The future prospects, such as the synergistic effects among the active compounds in coarse cereals and the biomarker signatures of CLGI, were also discussed. Coarse cereals show promise as food diet resources for preventing CLGI in diseased individuals. Their active ingredients, including \u03b2-glucan, resistant starch, arabinoxylan, phenolic acids, flavonoids, phytosterols and lignans, function against CLGI through multiple possible intracellular signaling pathways and immunomodulatory effects.

The trend toward delivering PC at home has been recently accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has created challenges for patients with serious illnesses who have been proven to be susceptible to serious COVID-19 illnesses. This review of the literature presents research studies on home PC (HPC) during the pandemic. Databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched. Twelve research/case studies were found to be relevant. These articles gathered information either through qualitative (surveys/interviews) methods or medical records. Most qualitative articles focused on perceived challenges and opportunities from HPC professionals' perspectives. Adopting telehealth was frequently discussed as a key tool to adjust to the pandemic. In general, HPC professionals and patients had a positive attitude toward telehealth, and this attitude was much more pronounced among professionals than patients. Among HPC professionals, some reports indicated that their burnout rates reduced, and job satisfaction increased during the pandemic. Regarding clinical and cost outcomes, there is a gap in the literature on HPC during the pandemic. In conclusion, despite challenges, it seems that the pandemic has gifted some long-term opportunities for promoting HPC in combination with telehealth.

Analysis of multiple datasets confirms the geobiochemical predictions for environmental redox gradients in hydrothermal systems, stratified lakes and marine environments, and shale gas wells. The geobiochemical signal is largest for the steep redox gradients associated with hydrothermal systems and between injected water and produced fluids from shale gas wells, demonstrating that microbial community composition can be a chemical proxy for environmental redox gradients.

The fractured vertebral body was filled with unidirectional porous beta-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) granules, and posterior spinal fixation was conducted using percutaneous pedicle screws. However, the pain did not improve, the inflammatory response increased, and bone destructive changes extended to T10. The correct diagnosis was pyogenic spondylitis with concomitant T11 fragility vertebral fracture. Revision surgery was conducted 2\u00a0weeks after the initial surgery, the T10 and T11 pedicle screws were removed, and refixation was conducted. After the revision surgery, the pain improved and mobilization proceeded. The infection was suppressed by the administration of sensitive antibiotics. One month after surgery, a lateral bone bridge appeared at the T10/11 intervertebral level. This increased in size over time, and synostosis was achieved at 6\u00a0months. Resorption of the unidirectional porous \u03b2-TCP granules was observed over time and partial replacement with autologous bone was evident from 6\u00a0months after the revision surgery. Two years and 6\u00a0months after the revision surgery, although there were some residual \u03b2-TCP and bony defect in the center of the vertebral body, the bilateral walls have well regenerated. This suggested that given an environment of sensitive antibiotic administration and restricted local instability, unidirectional porous \u03b2-TCP implanted into an infected vertebral body may function as a resorbable bone regeneration scaffold without impeding infection control even without debridement of the infected bony cavity.",

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing now reveal that HER2 is subject to mutation, with over 2,000 unique variants observed in human cancers. Several examples of oncogenic HER2 mutations have been described, and these primarily occur at allosteric sites outside the ATP-binding site. To identify the full spectrum of oncogenic HER2 driver mutations aside from a few well-studied mutations, we developed mutation-allostery-pharmacology (MAP), an in silico prediction algorithm based on machine learning. By applying this computational approach to 820 single-nucleotide variants, a list of 222 known and potential driver mutations was produced. Of these 222 mutations, 111 were screened by Ba/F3-retrovirus proliferation assays; 37 HER2 mutations were experimentally determined to be driver mutations, comprising 15 previously characterized and 22 newly identified oncogenic mutations. These oncogenic mutations mostly affected allosteric sites in the extracellular domain (ECD), transmembrane domain, and kinase domain of HER2, with only a single mutation in the HER2 orthosteric ATP site. Covalent homodimerization was established as a common mechanism of activation among HER2 ECD allosteric mutations, including the most prevalent HER2 mutation, S310F. Furthermore, HER2 allosteric mutants with enhanced covalent homodimerization were characterized by altered pharmacology that reduces the activity of existing anti-HER2 agents, including the mAb trastuzumab and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. Overall, the MAP-scoring and functional validation analyses provided new insights into the oncogenic activity and therapeutic targeting of HER2 mutations in cancer.",

The principle of sensing is based on the doping process of graphene due to the adsorption of the chemical molecules that serve as charge carriers. The sensor action under critical coupling results in generating the mid-infrared fano-resonance of the half-absorption band. Then, manipulating the graphene Fermi energy and geometrical parameters, a high quality factor can be attained in the resonance frequency that can provide the sensing possibility through the wavelength interrogation method. The results demonstrate that the proposed sensor can detect the chemicals with spectral shifts of 10 pm for steps of 5 charge carriers which is equal to a resolution smaller than 0.1ppm . Compared with other types of chemical graphene-based sensors employing optical fibers and plasmonic Fabry-Perot cavity, high resolution and sensitivity as well as the very simple geometry of the proposed sensing structure make it a promising candidate for ultra-sensitive chemical and biochemical detection.",

However, the inherent short channel effects limit their sensitivity, scalability and energy-efficiency. Therefore, to realize the true potential of the DMFET based biosensors, in this work, we propose a highly scalable, extremely sensitive and energy-efficient DM nanotube tunnel FET (NT-TFET) biosensor for label-free detection of biomolecules by modifying the structure of the conventional NT-TFET. The modified architecture facilitates the realization of a nanocavity at the source-channel tunneling junction and also provides stability to the immobilized biomolecules. We have performed an extensive analysis of the performance of the proposed DM NT-TFET biosensor in the presence of different representative target biomolecules characterized by different dielectric constants, and/or ionized charge densities using calibrated TCAD simulations. Our results indicate that the proposed DM NT-TFET exhibits an extremely high threshold voltage sensitivity ( S<sub>V<sub>th</sub></sub> ) of 0.44, a high selectivity exceeding four orders of magnitude, ON-state current sensitivity ( S<sub>I<sub>ON</sub></sub> ) of more than five orders of magnitude and could be a promising alternative to the conventional FET based dielectric modulated biosensors. Moreover, the sensitivity of the proposed DM NT-TFET could be further improved by utilizing alternate source materials with lower bandgap or by probing the transient response of the drain current and exploiting the difference in the settling time for different biomolecules with different dielectric constant ( &#954; ).",

Unfortunately, most machine learning architectures are not designed to directly handle sparse data, like that generated from event cameras.

This paper details an event representation called Time-Ordered Recent Event (TORE) volumes. TORE volumes are designed to compactly store raw spike timing information with minimal information loss. This bio-inspired design is memory efficient, computationally fast, avoids time-blocking (i.e., fixed and predefined frame rates), and contains \"local memory\" from past data. The design is evaluated on a wide range of challenging tasks (e.g., event denoising, image reconstruction, classification, and human pose estimation) and is shown to dramatically improve state-of-the-art performance.

Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the reliability of both the multi-view integration and the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and out-of-distribution data. Dynamically assessing the trustworthiness of each view for different samples could provide reliable integration. This can be achieved through uncertainty estimation. With this in mind, we propose a novel multi-view classification algorithm, termed trusted multi-view classification (TMC), providing a new paradigm for multi-view learning by dynamically integrating different views at an evidence level. The proposed TMC can promote classification reliability by considering evidence from each view. Specifically, we introduce the variational Dirichlet to characterize the distribution of the class probabilities, parameterized with evidence from different views and integrated with the Dempster-Shafer theory. The unified learning framework induces accurate uncertainty and accordingly endows the model with both reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption.

In this paper, we propose hybrid ISTA to unfold ISTA with both pre-computed and learned parameters by incorporating free-form DNNs (i.e., DNNs with arbitrary feasible and reasonable network architectures), while ensuring theoretical convergence. We first develop HCISTA to improve the efficiency and flexibility of classical ISTA (with pre-computed parameters) without compromising the convergence rate in theory. Furthermore, the DNN-based hybrid algorithm is generalized to popular variants of learned ISTA, dubbed HLISTA, to enable a free architecture of learned parameters with a guarantee of linear convergence. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a convergence-provable framework that enables free-form DNNs in ISTA-based unfolded algorithms. This framework is general to endow arbitrary DNNs for solving linear inverse problems with convergence guarantees.

An automated system was designed to provide diameter measurements and associated measurement precision of images of a fuel droplet undergoing combustion in zero gravity for the FLEX-2 dataset. An image gradient-based, least-squares boundary point fitting method to a circle or ellipse model is used for diameter measurement. The presence of soot aggregates poses significant challenges for diameter measurements when it occludes part of the droplet boundary. The precision of the diameter measurements depends upon the image quality. Using synthetic image simulations that model the soot behavior, we developed a model based on image quality measures that assesses the measurement precision for each individual diameter measurement. Thus, diameter measurements with precision assessments were made available for follow-up scientific analysis. The algorithm's success rate for measurable runs was 98%.

To recommend compounds as new drug candidates, applying the computational approaches has a lower cost than conducting the wet-lab experiments. Machine learning-based methods, especially deep learning-based methods, have advantages in learning complex feature interactions between compounds and proteins. However, deep learning models will over-generalize and lead to the problem of predicting less relevant compound-protein pairs when the compound-protein feature interactions are high-dimensional sparse. This problem can be overcome by learning both low-order and high-order feature interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model with Factorization Machines and Graph Neural Network called FMGNN to extract the low-order and high-order features, respectively. Then, we design a compound-protein interactions (CPIs) prediction method with pharmacophore features of compound and physicochemical properties of amino acids. The pharmacophore features can ensure that the prediction results much more fit the expectation of biological experiment and the physicochemical properties of amino acids are loaded into the embedding layer to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of protein feature learning. The experimental results on several datasets, especially on an imbalanced large-scale dataset, showed that our proposed method outperforms other existing methods for CPI prediction. The western blot experiment results on wogonin and its candidate target proteins also showed that our proposed method is effective and accurate for finding target proteins.

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments on two benchmark datasets (the Human MicroRNA Disease Database v2.0 and v3.2) and report the averages over 10 runs in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods.

This paper focuses on the theoretical and experimental study of noncontact respiratory and cardiac motion signals separation by remote sensing using a four-dimensional (4D) imaging radar.

VMS is established on optimizing a variational problem to separate different modes. It minimizes the energy overlap of the heartbeat and respiration signals as well as their harmonics with an equality constraint. Both simulation and real scene data results show that the proposed VMS algorithm is suitable for separating the weaker cardiac motion pattern from the strong respiratory motion pattern, restraining the influence of respiration harmonics on the heartbeat component. Furthermore, we have implemented continuous remote monitoring of respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) by employing the proposed method in a real scene. The results validate the consistency with the reference respiration belt and electrocardiogram (ECG).

        "abstract_text": "The imaging genetics approach generates large amount of high dimensional and multi-modal data, providing complementary information for comprehensive study of Schizophrenia, a complex mental disease. However, at the same time, the variety of these data in structures, resolutions, and formats makes their integrative study a forbidding task. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Joint Sparse Collaborative Regression (JSCoReg), which can extract class-specific features from different health conditions/disease classes. We first evaluate the performance of feature selection in terms of Receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the ROC curve in the simulation experiment. We demonstrate that the JSCoReg model can achieve higher accuracy compared with similar models including Joint Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis and Sparse Collaborative Regression. We then applied the JSCoReg model to the analysis of schizophrenia dataset collected from the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium. The JSCoReg enables us to better identify biomarkers associated with schizophrenia, which are verified to be both biologically and statistically significant.",

        "abstract_text": "Deciphering the free energy landscape of biomolecular structure space is crucial for understanding many complex molecular processes, such as protein-protein interaction, RNA folding, and protein folding. A major source of current dynamic structure data is Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Several methods have been proposed to investigate the free energy landscape from MD data, but all of them rely on the assumption that kinetic similarity is associated with global geometric similarity, which may lead to unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we proposed a new method called Conditional Angle Partition Tree to reveal the hierarchical free energy landscape by correlating local geometric similarity with kinetic similarity. Its application on the benchmark alanine dipeptide MD data showed a much better performance than existing methods in exploring and understanding the free energy landscape. We also applied it to the MD data of Villin HP35. Our results are more reasonable on various aspects than those from other methods and very informative on the hierarchical structure of its energy landscape.",

        "abstract_text": "Internet-Delivered Psychological Treatment (IDPT) has become necessary in the medical field. Deep neural networks (DNNs) require large, diverse patient populations to train models that achieve clinician-level performance. However, DNN models trained on limited datasets have poor clinical performance when used in a new location with different data. Thus, increasing the availability of diverse as well as distinct training data is vital. This study proposes a structural hypergraph as well as an emotional lexicon for word representation. An embedding model based on federated learning was developed for mental health symptom detection. The model treats text data as a collection of consecutive words. The model then learns a low-dimensional continuous vector while maintaining contextual linkage. The generated models with attention-based mechanisms as well as federated learning are then tested experimentally. Our strategy is suitable for vocabulary diversification, grammatical word representation, as well as dynamic lexicon analysis. The goal is to create semantic word representations using an attention network model. Later, clinical processes are used to mark the text by embedding it. Experimental results show the encoding of emotional words using the structural hypergraph. The 0.86 ROC was achieved using the bidirectional LSTM architecture with an attention mechanism.",

        "abstract_text": "Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a striking framework for allowing machine and deep learning models with thousands of participants to have distributed training to preserve the privacy of users' data. Federated learning comes with the pros of allowing all participants the possibility of creating robust models even in the absence of sufficient training data. Recently, smartphone usage has increased significantly due to its portability and ability to perform many daily life tasks. Typing on a smartphone's soft keyboard generates vibrations that could be abused to detect the typed keys, aiding side-channel attacks. Such data can be collected using smartphone hardware sensors during the entry of sensitive information such as clinical notes, personal medical information, username, and passwords. This study proposes a novel framework based on federated learning for side-channel attack detection to secure this information. We collected a dataset from 10 Android smartphone users who were asked to type on the smartphone soft keyboard. We convert this dataset into two windows of five users to make two clients training local models. The federated learning-based framework aggregates model updates contributed by two clients and trained the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model individually on the dataset. To reduce the over-fitting factor, each client examines the findings three times. Experiments reveal that the DNN model achieves an accuracy of 80.09%, showing that the proposed framework has the potential to detect side-channel attacks.",

We conducted a systematic review of studies assessing the experiences of parents regarding the role they play in the sexual education of their children. We included qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies conducted among parents in Europe. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, and screened 20,244 unique records. Forty-nine studies enrolling 18,083 unique parents met inclusion criteria. The studies show that parents have ideals regarding the sexual education of their children that center around the importance of trust, open conversations, and honesty. However, challenges and concerns, related to parents' and children's gender, children's age, children's specific situations, and limited parental knowledge and communication skills prevented them from living up to these ideals. Parents pointed to the role of other institutions as ways to support and strengthen parents' contributions to the sexual development of their children. We conclude that parents may require guidance and support to identify what is appropriate sexual education for their children, based on age, gender, and other characteristics, how to provide appropriate sexual education, and to strengthen their sexual communication skills and knowledge of contemporary sexual health issues.",

Most studies have focused on primary care providers; however, the administration of inclusive healthcare also relies on medical specialists, who should be considered a specific group because their practice varies significantly in this regard. Semi-directive interviews were conducted with 12 medical specialists to explore their representations regarding the care of people with intellectual disabilities. An inductive thematic analysis was applied to the data. The results highlighted a significant heterogeneity between practitioners' representations of people with intellectual disabilities in healthcare, current practices, and their perceptions and expectations in the process of ensuring quality care. This study highlights the importance of considering medical specialists' awareness raising and training to handle consultations with people with intellectual disabilities. From a broader perspective, a clear political framework to guide healthcare practices at the national level should be developed.",
