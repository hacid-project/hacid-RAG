Usage:
1. Download the .zip file of the index with the shared directory (HACID/Work/Medical Diagnostics/RAGIE/Snomed_index/snomed_dataset_nodoc_commandr_minilml6v2.zip). Note this is a partial knowledge base for test.
2. Unzip the file and put it into the "index" folder. (If there is no "index" folder, create a new one under the root directory.)
3. Open the "rag_playground.ipynb" to run the demo. This notebook contains several working scenarios for one sample input. For testing file input, run rag_extraction.py.
